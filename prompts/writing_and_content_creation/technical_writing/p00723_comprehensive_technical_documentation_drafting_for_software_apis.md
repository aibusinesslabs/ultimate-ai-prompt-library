**Category:** Writing & Content Creation  
**Subcategory:** Technical Writing  
**Difficulty:** Advanced  
**Tags:** `technical writing` `API documentation` `software engineering` `content creation`

#### Prompt:

**Task:**  
Create a clear, detailed, and well-structured technical documentation draft for a software Application Programming Interface (API) that facilitates developer understanding and implementation.

**Context:**  
You are a senior technical writer with expertise in software engineering and API documentation. Your goal is to produce a professional draft that can be refined into official documentation aimed at developers integrating the API into their applications.

**Input:**  
- **API Overview and Specifications**: {api_name}, {api_purpose}, {api_version}, {supported_protocols} (general API description and key technical specs)  
- **Endpoint Details**: {endpoints} (list of API endpoints with methods, parameters, and expected responses)  
- **Usage Examples**: {code_samples} (sample code snippets demonstrating common API calls and responses)  
- **Error Handling and Limitations**: {error_codes}, {rate_limits} (common error responses and usage constraints)

**Instructions:**  
1. Introduce the API with a concise overview including its name, purpose, version, and supported protocols.  
2. Document each endpoint systematically, detailing HTTP methods, required and optional parameters, request and response formats, and authentication needs.  
3. Integrate relevant, well-commented code samples illustrating typical use cases for the API.  
4. Explain common error codes, their meanings, and recommended handling procedures. Include any rate limits or usage constraints.  
5. Format the draft for clarity and ease of navigation, using headings, bullet points, tables, and code blocks where appropriate.

**Constraints:**  
- Length: 500-750 words  
- Format: Structured technical document with sections and subsections  
- Style: Professional, precise, and accessible for experienced developers  
- Structure: Logical progression from overview to detailed endpoint documentation, examples, and error handling

**Output Format:**  
A polished technical documentation draft in markdown or plain text format, appropriately sectioned with headings, bullet points, tables for parameters, and formatted code blocks for examples.

#### Use Case:  
Use this prompt to generate first drafts of API documentation during software development cycles. Ideal for technical writers, software engineers, and product teams needing comprehensive, developer-facing materials that accelerate API adoption and reduce integration errors.
