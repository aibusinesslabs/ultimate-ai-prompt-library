#### Prompt:

**Task:**  
Create a clear, concise, and user-friendly API documentation section that explains a specific endpoint including its purpose, parameters, request/response examples, and error handling.

**Context:**  
You are a technical writer tasked with producing precise and accessible API documentation for developers. The goal is to ensure users can easily understand how to use the API endpoint effectively, reducing support inquiries.

**Input:**  
- **Endpoint Details:** {endpoint_name}, {endpoint_description} (name and short description of the API endpoint)  
- **Parameters:** {parameter_list} (list of parameters, including names, types, required/optional status, and descriptions)  
- **Request and Response Examples:** {request_example}, {response_example} (sample JSON or code snippets demonstrating request and response)  
- **Error Handling:** {common_errors} (list of possible error codes with descriptions and suggested resolutions)  

**Instructions:**  
1. Begin with a brief introduction summarizing the endpoint’s purpose and typical use cases.  
2. Clearly list and define each parameter, specifying type, requirement status, and expected values.  
3. Provide formatted request and response examples that are easy to read and understand.  
4. Describe common errors, their causes, and troubleshooting tips to help developers resolve issues independently.  
5. Ensure language is professional yet accessible, avoiding jargon where possible, and maintaining consistent terminology throughout.  

**Constraints:**  
- Length: 300-500 words  
- Format: Use markdown-style headings and bullet points for readability  
- Style: Professional, clear, and concise with a focus on usability  
- Structure: Logical flow—introduction, parameters, examples, error handling  

**Output Format:**  
A well-structured markdown-formatted API documentation snippet ready to be integrated into a developer portal or technical manual.

#### Use Case:  
Use this prompt when creating or updating API documentation to improve developer experience and reduce onboarding time. Ideal for technical writers, product managers, or API developers who need precise, easy-to-understand documentation for external or internal APIs.
