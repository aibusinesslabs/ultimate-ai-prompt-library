#### Prompt:

**Task:**  
Create a thorough, clear, and professional technical document that explains the design, usage, and integration of a software API for developers.

**Context:**  
You are a senior technical writer tasked with producing high-quality API documentation to assist software engineers in understanding and implementing the API effectively. The documentation will be part of a larger developer portal and must meet industry standards for clarity and completeness.

**Input:**  
- **API Overview & Specifications**: {{api_name}}, {{api_version}}, {{api_description}} (name, version, and brief description of the API)  
- **Endpoints & Methods**: {{endpoint_list}} (list of endpoints with HTTP methods, parameters, and expected responses)  
- **Authentication & Error Handling**: {{auth_method}}, {{error_codes}} (authentication approach and common error codes with descriptions)  
- **Integration Examples & Best Practices**: {{code_samples}}, {{usage_tips}} (sample code snippets and recommended usage guidelines)

**Instructions:**  
1. Introduce the API with a clear overview covering its purpose, versioning, and key features.  
2. Document each endpoint methodically, detailing URL structure, HTTP methods, request parameters, headers, and response formats.  
3. Explain the authentication mechanism and provide a comprehensive list of possible error codes with their meanings and troubleshooting advice.  
4. Include practical integration examples with well-commented code snippets demonstrating common use cases.  
5. Conclude with best practices and recommendations for efficient, secure implementation and maintenance.

**Constraints:**  
- Length: 500-750 words  
- Format: Use markdown formatting including headings, subheadings, bullet points, and code blocks  
- Style: Professional, concise, and technically precise; avoid jargon without explanation  
- Structure: Logical flow from overview to detailed sections, ending with examples and best practices

**Output Format:**  
A complete markdown-formatted technical API documentation draft suitable for inclusion in a developer portal.

#### Use Case:  
This prompt is ideal for technical writers or software engineers tasked with creating or updating API documentation to improve developer onboarding and integration efficiency. It ensures consistent, clear, and professional documentation that saves development time and reduces support queries.
