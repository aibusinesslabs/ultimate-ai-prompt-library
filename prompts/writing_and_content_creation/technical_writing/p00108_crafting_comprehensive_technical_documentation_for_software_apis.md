**Category:** Writing & Content Creation  
**Subcategory:** Technical Writing  
**Difficulty:** Advanced  
**Tags:** `technical writing` `API documentation` `software engineering` `content creation`

#### Prompt:

**Task:**  
Create a detailed, clear, and well-structured technical document that thoroughly explains a software API, enabling developers to understand, integrate, and troubleshoot it effectively.

**Context:**  
You are a senior technical writer with expertise in software engineering and API documentation. Your objective is to produce professional-level documentation that balances technical accuracy with accessibility, catering primarily to experienced developers but also accessible to intermediate users.

**Input:**  
- **API Overview and Specifications:** {api_name}, {api_version}, {api_purpose} (high-level description and core functions)  
- **Endpoints and Methods:** {endpoints_list} (list of endpoints including HTTP methods, parameters, and expected responses)  
- **Authentication and Security:** {auth_methods} (details on authentication protocols, tokens, and access controls)  
- **Error Handling and Examples:** {error_codes}, {code_snippets} (common error messages and annotated example requests/responses)

**Instructions:**  
1. Introduce the API with a succinct summary of its purpose, version, and target users.  
2. Document each endpoint methodically, including URL, method, parameters (required and optional), request/response formats, and sample usage.  
3. Explain the authentication mechanisms clearly, detailing setup steps and security considerations.  
4. Provide a comprehensive section on error handling: list typical error codes, their meanings, and recommended troubleshooting steps.  
5. Incorporate clear, commented code examples demonstrating typical API calls and responses in a popular programming language (e.g., Python, JavaScript).

**Constraints:**  
- Length: 500-750 words  
- Format: Use clear headings, bullet points, tables for parameters, and code blocks for examples  
- Style: Professional, precise, and accessible language suitable for technical audiences  
- Structure: Logical flow with an introduction, endpoint documentation, authentication, error handling, and examples sections

**Output Format:**  
A fully formatted technical document ready for developer consumption, including structured sections, tables, and code blocks, delivered as plain text optimized for markdown or similar markup languages.

#### Use Case:  
This prompt is ideal for technical writers, software engineers, or product teams preparing API documentation for new or updated software products. It ensures documentation is comprehensive, developer-friendly, and facilitates smooth integration and troubleshooting.
