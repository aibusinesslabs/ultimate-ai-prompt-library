**Difficulty:** Advanced  
**Tags:** `technical writing` `API documentation` `software engineering` `developer communication`

#### Prompt:

**Task:**  
Create a detailed, clear, and comprehensive technical documentation for a software API that enables developers to understand, implement, and troubleshoot the API efficiently.

**Context:**  
You are a senior technical writer in a software development company tasked with producing professional API documentation to support a new software product. Your documentation will serve as the primary resource for external developers integrating with the API, ensuring clarity, completeness, and usability.

**Input:**  
- **API Overview and Functionality**: {{api_name}}, {{api_purpose}}, {{primary_functions}} (Brief description of the API, its purpose, and main functionalities)  
- **Endpoints and Parameters**: {{endpoint_list}}, {{parameter_descriptions}} (List of API endpoints with detailed descriptions of required and optional parameters)  
- **Authentication and Error Handling**: {{auth_method}}, {{error_codes}} (Details on authentication methods used and common error codes with explanations)  
- **Usage Examples and Best Practices**: {{code_samples}}, {{integration_tips}} (Code snippets demonstrating typical API usage and recommended integration practices)

**Instructions:**  
1. Begin with a concise introduction to the API, outlining its purpose and core features.  
2. Document each API endpoint methodically, detailing the HTTP method, endpoint URL, required and optional parameters, data formats, and expected responses.  
3. Explain the authentication mechanisms clearly, including token management or other authorization methods.  
4. Provide a thorough overview of common error codes and troubleshooting steps to aid developers in debugging.  
5. Include practical code examples for key API interactions and conclude with best practices or tips for seamless integration.

**Constraints:**  
- Length: 500-750 words  
- Format: Use clear headings, bullet points for parameters and error codes, and code blocks for examples  
- Style: Professional, concise, and technically precise with no jargon ambiguity  
- Structure: Logical flow from overview, detailed endpoint descriptions, authentication, error handling, to usage examples and best practices

**Output Format:**  
A well-structured technical document in markdown or plain text with headings, subheadings, bullet lists, and formatted code examples ready for developer consumption.

#### Use Case:  
This prompt is ideal for technical writers or software engineers tasked with producing API documentation that enhances developer experience and reduces support overhead. It suits scenarios where clarity and depth are essential for external developer adoption and integration success.
