**Category:** Writing & Content Creation  
**Subcategory:** Technical Writing  
**Difficulty:** Intermediate  
**Tags:** `API` `documentation` `technical writing` `clarity`

#### Prompt:

**Task:**  
Create a clear, concise, and user-friendly API documentation section that explains the purpose, usage, and examples of a specific API endpoint.

**Context:**  
You are a technical writer tasked with producing professional API documentation for software developers. The documentation should enable users to understand the endpoint’s function, required parameters, response format, and provide practical usage examples.

**Input:**  
- **Endpoint Details:** {endpoint_name}, {endpoint_url}, {http_method} (name, URL, and HTTP method of the API endpoint)  
- **Parameters:** {parameter_list} (detailed list of parameters including name, type, and description)  
- **Response:** {response_structure} (description of the expected response format and key fields)  
- **Example:** {example_request}, {example_response} (sample API request and corresponding response)

**Instructions:**  
1. Introduce the API endpoint with its name and brief description of its purpose.  
2. Clearly list and explain each parameter, including required vs optional status and data types.  
3. Describe the structure of the API response, highlighting important fields and data formats.  
4. Provide a code sample or example request demonstrating how to call the endpoint.  
5. Include the example response to illustrate what users should expect when calling the endpoint.

**Constraints:**  
- Length: 300-500 words  
- Format: Use clear headings, bullet points for parameters, and code blocks for examples  
- Style: Professional, concise, and accessible for developers with intermediate technical knowledge  
- Structure: Logical flow from introduction, parameters, response details, to examples

**Output Format:**  
A well-structured API documentation snippet formatted with headings, bullet points, and code blocks suitable for integration into developer portals or technical manuals.

#### Use Case:  
Use this prompt to streamline the creation of API documentation that enhances developer understanding and integration efficiency. Ideal for technical writers or product teams preparing developer-facing materials for new or updated API endpoints.
