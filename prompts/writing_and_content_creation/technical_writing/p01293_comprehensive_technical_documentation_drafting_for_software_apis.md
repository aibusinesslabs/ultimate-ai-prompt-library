**Subcategory:** Technical Writing  
**Difficulty:** Advanced  
**Tags:** `technical writing` `API documentation` `software engineering` `content creation`

#### Prompt:

**Task:**  
Create a detailed, clear, and professional technical document that thoroughly explains the functionality, usage, and integration process of a software API.

**Context:**  
You are a senior technical writer with expertise in software development documentation. Your goal is to produce a comprehensive API guide that supports developers in understanding and effectively integrating the API into their applications. The document should be precise, accessible to intermediate to advanced developers, and adhere to best practices in technical communication.

**Input:**  
- **API Details:** {api_name}, {api_version}, {authentication_method} (Basic metadata and security requirements)  
- **Endpoint Specifications:** {endpoint_list} (List of API endpoints with parameters, request/response formats)  
- **Use Cases:** {primary_use_cases} (Typical scenarios and workflows for API utilization)  
- **Error Handling:** {error_codes}, {error_messages} (Common error responses and recommended troubleshooting steps)

**Instructions:**  
1. Begin with an introduction that outlines the purpose, scope, and key features of the {api_name} API including version and authentication requirements.  
2. Document each endpoint from the {endpoint_list} with detailed descriptions, supported HTTP methods, required parameters, and examples of request and response payloads.  
3. Illustrate the {primary_use_cases} through step-by-step integration workflows or code snippets that demonstrate practical application of the API.  
4. Include a comprehensive error handling section that maps the {error_codes} and {error_messages} to potential causes and recommended resolutions.  
5. Conclude with best practices, tips for optimization, and links to additional resources or support channels.

**Constraints:**  
- Length: Between 500 and 750 words  
- Format: Structured technical document with headings, subheadings, bullet points, and code blocks/examples where appropriate  
- Style: Professional, clear, concise, and jargon-appropriate for technical audiences  
- Structure: Logical flow starting from overview, detailed specifications, practical examples, error handling, and closing recommendations

**Output Format:**  
Deliver a well-organized technical document in Markdown format, including properly formatted headings, lists, code blocks, and hyperlinks where relevant.

#### Use Case:  
Use this prompt to generate comprehensive API documentation that facilitates developer onboarding and integration efforts. It benefits technical writers, software development teams, and product managers who need clear and effective communication of API capabilities and usage scenarios for internal or external users. Ideal for API launches, updates, or developer portal content creation.
