**Category:** Writing & Content Creation  
**Subcategory:** Technical Writing  
**Difficulty:** Advanced  
**Tags:** `technical writing` `software documentation` `feature specification` `user manual`

#### Prompt:

**Task:**  
Create a comprehensive technical document that clearly explains the functionality, usage, and implementation details of a specified software feature, tailored for both developers and end-users.

**Context:**  
You are a senior technical writer tasked with producing detailed documentation for a new software feature. The document must bridge the gap between technical precision and user-friendly explanations, supporting developers in implementation and end-users in understanding the feature’s benefits and usage.

**Input:**  
- **Feature Details:** {feature_name}, {feature_description} (name and detailed description of the software feature)  
- **Technical Specifications:** {functional_requirements}, {system_dependencies} (functional requirements and system dependencies)  
- **User Scenarios:** {user_roles}, {usage_examples} (target user roles and practical usage examples)  
- **Implementation Notes:** {integration_guidelines}, {known_limitations} (guidelines for integration and any known limitations or caveats)

**Instructions:**  
1. Begin with an executive summary that introduces the feature purpose and high-level benefits.  
2. Elaborate on the technical specifications, describing functional requirements and system dependencies clearly and precisely.  
3. Outline detailed user scenarios illustrating how various user roles interact with the feature, including concrete usage examples.  
4. Provide step-by-step implementation notes, integration guidelines, and highlight any known limitations or troubleshooting tips.  
5. Conclude with a glossary of key terms and references to additional resources or related documentation.

**Constraints:**  
- Length: 500-750 words  
- Format: Use clear headings and subheadings, bullet points, and numbered lists where appropriate for readability  
- Style: Professional, precise, and accessible; balance technical accuracy with clarity for non-expert users  
- Structure: Logical flow from overview to technical details, user guidance, implementation, and glossary

**Output Format:**  
A well-structured technical document in markdown or HTML format with appropriate headings, lists, and emphasis to support both developer and user comprehension.

#### Use Case:  
Use this prompt when preparing technical documentation for new or updated software features requiring clear, dual-audience communication. It is ideal for technical writers, product managers, or developers aiming to produce accessible yet thorough documentation to facilitate feature adoption and integration.
