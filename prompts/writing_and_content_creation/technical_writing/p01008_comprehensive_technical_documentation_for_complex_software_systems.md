**Category:** Writing & Content Creation  
**Subcategory:** Technical Writing  
**Difficulty:** Advanced  
**Tags:** `technical writing` `software documentation` `system architecture` `user guide`

#### Prompt:

**Task:**  
Create a detailed and comprehensive technical document that explains the architecture, functionalities, and usage instructions of a complex software system tailored for both developers and end-users.

**Context:**  
You are a senior technical writer with expertise in complex software systems documentation. Your goal is to produce clear, structured, and precise documentation that bridges technical depth and accessibility, ensuring that developers understand the system architecture and that end-users can effectively operate the software.

**Input:**  
- **System Overview & Architecture**: {system_name}, {system_purpose}, {key_components} (high-level description of the software system and its major architectural elements)  
- **Functional Specifications**: {primary_features}, {user_roles} (core functionalities and user roles supported by the system)  
- **Installation & Configuration**: {installation_steps}, {system_requirements} (step-by-step setup and environment prerequisites)  
- **Usage & Troubleshooting**: {common_tasks}, {error_handling_procedures} (typical user workflows and troubleshooting guidelines)

**Instructions:**  
1. Begin with an executive summary highlighting the system’s purpose and target audience.  
2. Describe the system architecture, including diagrams or component breakdowns, emphasizing how key components interact.  
3. Detail each primary feature and associated user roles, explaining their scope and limitations.  
4. Provide clear, sequential installation and configuration instructions that cover all prerequisites and potential environment-specific considerations.  
5. Outline typical usage scenarios with step-by-step guidance and include a troubleshooting section addressing common errors and their resolutions.

**Constraints:**  
- Length: 500-750 words  
- Format: Use clear headings, bullet points, and numbered lists where appropriate; include at least one diagram description (text-based) of system architecture  
- Style: Professional, precise, and accessible for both technical and semi-technical readers  
- Structure: Logical flow from overview to technical details, concluding with practical usage and troubleshooting

**Output Format:**  
A polished technical document in markdown format, structured with headings (H1, H2, H3), bullet points, numbered lists, and a text-based system architecture diagram description.

#### Use Case:  
This prompt is ideal for technical writers tasked with documenting complex software solutions to facilitate onboarding of new developers and end-users. It ensures the creation of balanced documentation that supports software maintenance, user adoption, and troubleshooting in enterprise or product development environments.
