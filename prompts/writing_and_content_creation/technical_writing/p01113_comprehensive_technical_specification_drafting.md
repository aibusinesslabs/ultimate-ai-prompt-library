#### Prompt:

**Task:**  
Create a clear, concise, and professional technical specification document based on provided product details and requirements.

**Context:**  
You are a technical writer tasked with drafting a technical specification document for a new product. The document should provide comprehensive details to guide developers, engineers, and stakeholders in understanding the product’s functionalities, constraints, and design considerations.

**Input:**  
- **Product Overview and Features:** {{product_name}}, {{product_description}}, {{key_features}} (brief summary and major features)  
- **Technical Requirements:** {{hardware_requirements}}, {{software_requirements}}, {{performance_metrics}} (specific technical specifications)  
- **Constraints and Limitations:** {{design_constraints}}, {{regulatory_compliance}}, {{known_issues}} (limitations and compliance considerations)  
- **Target Audience and Usage:** {{end_users}}, {{usage_scenarios}}, {{environment_conditions}} (intended users and operational context)

**Instructions:**  
1. Introduce the product by summarizing {{product_name}} and {{product_description}} clearly.  
2. Detail the {{key_features}} emphasizing their technical relevance and application.  
3. Enumerate and explain the {{hardware_requirements}}, {{software_requirements}}, and {{performance_metrics}} precisely.  
4. Describe the {{design_constraints}}, {{regulatory_compliance}}, and {{known_issues}} to acknowledge design boundaries and compliance needs.  
5. Define the {{end_users}}, typical {{usage_scenarios}}, and {{environment_conditions}} to contextualize the product deployment.  

**Constraints:**  
- Length: 300-500 words  
- Format: Use clear headings and bullet points where appropriate for readability  
- Style: Professional, precise, and objective tone suitable for technical audiences
