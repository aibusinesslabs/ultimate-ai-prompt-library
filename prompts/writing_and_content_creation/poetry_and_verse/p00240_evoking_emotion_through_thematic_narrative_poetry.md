**Instructions:**

3. Integrate at least three distinct poetic devices (e.g., alliteration, enjambment, rhyme scheme) to enhance rhythm and mood while maintaining narrative clarity.  
4. Build toward a resolution that reflects the chosen resolution preference, ensuring that the thematic message is clear but nuanced.
