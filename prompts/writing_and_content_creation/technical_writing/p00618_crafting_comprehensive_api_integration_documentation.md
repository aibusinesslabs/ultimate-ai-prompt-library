**Category:** Writing & Content Creation  
**Subcategory:** Technical Writing  
**Difficulty:** Advanced  
**Tags:** `API` `technical documentation` `integration` `developer guide`

#### Prompt:

**Task:**  
Create a detailed and clear API integration guide that enables developers to understand, implement, and troubleshoot the integration of a specified API within their applications.

**Context:**  
You are an expert technical writer specializing in software documentation. Your goal is to produce a professional API integration guide that caters to developers with intermediate to advanced programming skills, ensuring they can easily adopt the API and resolve common issues.

**Input:**  
- **API Details**: {api_name}, {api_version} (Name and version of the API)  
- **Authentication Methods**: {auth_type}, {auth_process} (Type of authentication used and step-by-step process)  
- **Endpoints Overview**: {endpoint_list} (List of key API endpoints with brief descriptions)  
- **Error Handling & Troubleshooting**: {common_errors}, {resolution_steps} (Typical errors and recommended solutions)

**Instructions:**  
1. Introduce the API by providing a concise overview including its purpose and primary use cases.  
2. Explain the authentication requirements and provide clear, step-by-step instructions to obtain and use credentials securely.  
3. Document each key API endpoint with endpoint URL, HTTP method, required parameters, sample requests, and example responses in JSON or XML as applicable.  
4. Include a dedicated section for common errors, describing each error code, its meaning, and detailed troubleshooting or resolution advice.  
5. Conclude with best practices, tips for efficient integration, and references to official API resources or support channels.

**Constraints:**  
- Length: 500-750 words  
- Format: Use clear headings, bullet points, and code blocks as needed for readability  
- Style: Professional, precise, and accessible to technically proficient readers  
- Structure: Logical flow with distinct sections for overview, authentication, endpoints, error handling, and best practices

**Output Format:**  
A structured technical document in markdown format including headings, subheadings, code snippets, and bullet lists to neatly organize the API integration guide.

#### Use Case:  
Use this prompt when you need to produce high-quality API documentation for software development teams integrating third-party or internal APIs. It benefits technical writers, developer advocates, and product teams aiming to improve developer onboarding and reduce support overhead.
