#### Prompt:

Develop a polished, engaging opening scene for a feature-length film screenplay that effectively establishes the tone, setting, and primary conflict while introducing the main character and hinting at the central narrative arc.

**Instructions:**

4. Use screenplay formatting conventions (scene headings, action lines, character names, dialogue) to ensure industry-standard readability.  
5. Maintain the specified tone and visual style throughout, balancing show-don’t-tell techniques to engage viewers emotionally and intellectually.
