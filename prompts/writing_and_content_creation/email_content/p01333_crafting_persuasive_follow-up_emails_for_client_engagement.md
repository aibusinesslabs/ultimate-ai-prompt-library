**Context:**  
You are a sales or account manager seeking to maintain client interest and move the conversation forward after a promising but unclosed initial interaction.

- **Tone and Formality Preferences:** {tone_style}, {formality_level} (e.g., friendly/professional tone and level of formality)

**Instructions:**  
1. Begin with a courteous greeting addressing {client_name} and referencing the previous interaction on {meeting_date}.  
2. Briefly recap the {proposal_summary}, emphasizing the {key_benefits} and {unique_selling_points} tailored to {client_company}.  
3. Gently remind the client of the potential positive impact or solution your offering provides without sounding repetitive or aggressive.  
4. Include a clear, polite call to action encouraging a response, scheduling a follow-up meeting, or asking for feedback.  
5. Close the email professionally, reflecting the chosen {tone_style} and {formality_level}.
