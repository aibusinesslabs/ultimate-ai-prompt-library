**Instructions:**  
1. Develop a three-act structure outline clearly dividing the story into Setup, Confrontation, and Resolution.  
2. For each act, describe 3-5 pivotal scenes that advance the plot and develop characters, specifying their purpose and emotional impact.  
3. Define the protagonist’s and antagonist’s arcs, showing how their goals and conflicts evolve throughout the story.  
4. Integrate the central theme organically within the plot and character interactions, illustrating its influence on story decisions.  
5. Ensure the setting and tone are consistently reflected in scene descriptions and character behavior.
