**Subcategory:** Technical Writing  
**Difficulty:** Advanced  
**Tags:** `technical writing` `specification` `documentation` `engineering`

#### Prompt:

**Task:**  
Create a detailed technical specification document for a complex software or hardware product based on provided requirements and context.

**Context:**  
You are a senior technical writer specialized in producing clear, precise, and comprehensive specification documents that guide engineering teams through product development phases. Your documentation must align with best practices in technical writing and engineering standards to ensure clarity, usability, and completeness.

**Input:**  
- **Project Details**: {project_name}, {product_type}, {target_audience} (Basic information about the project and intended users)  
- **Functional Requirements**: {functions_list} (Detailed list of functional features and capabilities required)  
- **Non-Functional Requirements**: {performance_metrics}, {security_standards}, {compliance_requirements} (Quality attributes and regulatory constraints)  
- **Development Constraints**: {technology_stack}, {timeline}, {budget_limitations} (Technical environment and resource limitations)

**Instructions:**  
1. Begin with a concise executive summary that outlines the purpose and scope of the product.  
2. Elaborate on the functional requirements, breaking down each feature with clear descriptions, input/output expectations, and usage scenarios.  
3. Detail non-functional requirements, including performance targets, security protocols, compliance standards, and usability considerations.  
4. Specify any development constraints, such as chosen technologies, project timeline, and budgetary limits, and explain their implications on design decisions.  
5. Organize the document logically with appropriate headings, subheadings, tables, and diagrams where applicable to enhance readability and comprehension.

**Constraints:**  
- Length: 500-750 words  
- Format: Professional technical document style, using formal language and consistent terminology  
- Style: Clear, concise, and unambiguous language suitable for engineering teams and stakeholders  
- Structure: Must include Executive Summary, Functional Requirements, Non-Functional Requirements, Development Constraints, and Conclusion sections

**Output Format:**  
A well-structured technical specification document in markdown format with clear headings, bullet points, and tables as needed for clarity.

#### Use Case:  
This prompt is ideal for technical writers tasked with transforming raw product requirements into formal specification documents that guide development teams. It benefits engineering managers, product owners, and documentation specialists needing precise and actionable technical specs for software or hardware projects.
