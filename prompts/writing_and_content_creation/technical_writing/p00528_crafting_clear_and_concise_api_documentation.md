**Tags:** `API` `documentation` `technical writing` `clarity`

#### Prompt:

**Task:**  
Create clear, concise, and user-friendly API documentation for a technical audience that thoroughly explains the functionality and usage of a given API endpoint.

**Context:**  
You are a technical writer tasked with producing professional API documentation to help developers understand how to integrate and use a specific API endpoint efficiently. The documentation should balance technical accuracy with accessibility.

**Input:**  
- **API Endpoint Details:** {endpoint_name}, {endpoint_description} (name and brief overview of the API endpoint)  
- **Request Parameters:** {parameters} (list and description of all input parameters accepted by the endpoint)  
- **Response Structure:** {response_format} (description of the response format including key fields and data types)  
- **Usage Examples:** {example_requests}, {example_responses} (sample API requests and corresponding responses demonstrating typical usage)

**Instructions:**  
1. Provide a clear and concise summary of the API endpoint and its purpose.  
2. Document each request parameter with its name, type, required/optional status, and description.  
3. Describe the structure of the response, highlighting important fields and their data types.

**Constraints:**  
- Length: 300-500 words  
- Format: Use Markdown with headings, bullet points, and code blocks for examples  
- Style: Professional, clear, and concise technical writing  
- Structure: Logical flow—introduction, parameters, response, examples, summary

**Output Format:**  
Markdown-formatted API documentation text including headings, parameter tables or lists, response descriptions, and code blocks for examples.

#### Use Case:  
Use this prompt to generate professional API documentation for new or existing endpoints, helping developers quickly understand and implement the API. Ideal for technical writers, product teams, or developer advocates preparing resources for software integration.
