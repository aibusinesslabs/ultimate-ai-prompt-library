#### Prompt:

**Task:**  
Develop a detailed, professional outline for a feature-length film script that effectively integrates story structure, character arcs, and thematic elements to set the foundation for a full screenplay.

**Context:**  
You are a professional screenwriter tasked with creating a comprehensive feature film script outline. Your outline will serve as a blueprint for a full screenplay and must incorporate industry-standard story structure techniques, compelling character development, and a cohesive central theme that guides the narrative.

**Input:**  
- **Story Details:** {genre}, {setting}, {logline} (genre of the film, primary location/time period, and a concise one-sentence summary of the story)  
- **Main Characters:** {protagonist_name}, {protagonist_goal}, {antagonist_name}, {antagonist_goal} (names and core objectives/motivations of protagonist and antagonist)  
- **Plot Elements:** {key_conflicts}, {major_plot_points} (list of significant conflicts and pivotal plot developments)  
- **Thematic Focus:** {central_theme}, {moral_question} (overarching theme and key moral or philosophical question explored)

**Instructions:**  
1. Construct a three-act structure outline (Setup, Confrontation, Resolution) clearly defining the purpose and key events of each act.  
2. Detail the protagonist’s and antagonist’s character arcs, illustrating how their goals evolve and intersect throughout the story.  
3. Integrate the {key_conflicts} and {major_plot_points} organically within the narrative framework, ensuring logical progression and emotional impact.  
4. Emphasize how the {central_theme} and {moral_question} are reflected and reinforced by the story’s events and character decisions.  
5. Provide a concise summary of each act’s climax and turning points, highlighting their significance in advancing the plot and character development.

**Constraints:**  
- Length: 500-750 words  
- Format: Structured outline with clear headings for each act and sections for character arcs and thematic elements  
- Style: Professional, concise, and engaging, suitable for pitching to producers or collaborators  
- Structure: Must follow three-act screenplay paradigm and include explicit connections between plot, characters, and theme  

**Output Format:**  
A well-organized screenplay outline document divided into:  
- Act 1: Setup (including inciting incident)  
- Act 2: Confrontation (including midpoint and rising action)  
- Act 3: Resolution (including climax and denouement)  
- Character Arcs (protagonist and antagonist)  
- Thematic Integration (central theme and moral question exposition)

#### Use Case:  
Use this prompt when you need to create a clear, cohesive outline for a feature film screenplay that aligns story structure with character and theme development. Ideal for screenwriters preparing pitch materials or early drafts, producers assessing story viability, and creative teams establishing narrative direction before full scriptwriting.
