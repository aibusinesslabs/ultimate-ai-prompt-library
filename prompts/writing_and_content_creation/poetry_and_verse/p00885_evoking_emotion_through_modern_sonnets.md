#### Prompt:

**Task:**  
Craft a modern sonnet that powerfully evokes a complex emotional experience, blending classical form with contemporary language and themes.

**Context:**  
You are a skilled poet and literary artist tasked with creating a sonnet that bridges traditional poetic structure and modern sensibilities. The sonnet should explore deep emotional layers relevant to today’s social or personal contexts while respecting the formal constraints of the sonnet.

**Input:**  
- **Emotional Theme & Tone:** {primary_emotion}, {secondary_emotion} (e.g., longing and hope, melancholy and resilience)  
- **Subject & Setting:** {subject_matter}, {setting} (e.g., unrequited love in a bustling city, loss during a global crisis)  
- **Contemporary Elements:** {modern_references} (e.g., technology, social media, cultural phenomena)  
- **Structural Preferences:** {sonnet_type}, {rhyme_scheme} (e.g., Shakespearean with ABABCDCDEFEFGG, Petrarchan with ABBAABBACDCDCD)

**Instructions:**  
1. Compose a 14-line sonnet adhering strictly to the chosen {sonnet_type} and {rhyme_scheme}.  
2. Integrate the {primary_emotion} and {secondary_emotion} to create nuanced emotional depth throughout the poem.  
3. Incorporate the {subject_matter} and {setting} to ground the poem in a vivid, relatable context.  
4. Use {modern_references} subtly and meaningfully to update the sonnet’s thematic relevance without compromising classical formality.  
5. Ensure the language balances poetic elegance with contemporary diction, creating an accessible yet profound reading experience.

**Constraints:**  
- Length: 500-750 words (sonnet plus detailed artistic explanation or analysis)  
- Format: Poem followed by a concise critical commentary (approx. 150-250 words) analyzing the emotional and stylistic choices  
- Style: Sophisticated, evocative, and emotionally resonant; maintain sonnet conventions in meter and rhyme  
- Structure: 14 lines of poetry plus a prose section; clear distinction between poem and commentary

**Output Format:**  
A two-part deliverable:  
1. The full sonnet poem formatted in traditional stanza form.  
2. A critical commentary explaining how the poem’s language, structure, and themes convey the chosen emotional experience, referencing the contemporary elements and sonnet form integration.

#### Use Case:  
This prompt is ideal for poets, educators, and creative writers seeking to deepen their mastery of sonnet construction while exploring modern themes and emotional complexity.
